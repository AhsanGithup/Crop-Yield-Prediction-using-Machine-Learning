# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict crop yield based on environmental and regional factors. It was developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP) to demonstrate how data science can solve real-world problems in agriculture.

## 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: Kaggle - Crop Yield Prediction Dataset
* **Features**:

  * State
  * District
  * Crop
  * Season
  * Year

  * Rainfall
  * Pesticide
* **Target**: Yield (crop output per unit area)

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
* Seaborn, Matplotlib – Visualization
* Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Regression)
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

* Missing values handled
* Label Encoding for categorical features
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Dataset split into training and testing sets (80/20)

---

## 🤖 Model

* Linear Regression model was implemented
* Evaluation metrics:

  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * R² Score
* Model predicts crop yield based on various input features

---

## 📈 Results

* The model performed reasonably well on test data
* Rainfall and temperature were key features impacting yield
* The system can be useful for smart farming and agricultural decision-making

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Use of satellite or remote sensing data
* Deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks)
* Real-time weather data integration
* Deployment as a web-based decision support tool
